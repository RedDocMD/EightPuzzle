# FifteenPuzzle
Attempts to solve the Fifteen puzzle by using A* search

At the moment, it successfully solves a smaller variant of this puzzle, the **Eight puzzle**, by using vanilla A* search.
The Fifteen Puzzle plainly takes too long to solve and to much memory. An improved heuristic and switching to *iterative-deepening A* search* will help.
